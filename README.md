Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on various features of the tumor, 
such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness. The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is commonly 
used for binary classification tasks in medical research.

Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:

Python: Programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computing
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization libraries
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running the code and documenting results
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains the following columns:

Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, symmetry, etc.
Label: Diagnosis (M for malignant, B for benign)
The dataset has 569 observations and 32 features (including the target variable).

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd cancer-prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebook to execute the code:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the cancer_prediction.ipynb file and run the cells step-by-step to load the data, visualize it, preprocess the data, and train the model.
Model Training
We have implemented several machine learning algorithms to train the model, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize the features.
Feature Selection: Use techniques such as correlation matrix and feature importance to select significant features.
Model Training: Train the models using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Results
The models are evaluated on the test dataset, and the performance is compared based on the chosen metrics. For this dataset, Random Forest and SVM 
have provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and recall.

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Logistic Regression	96.5%	95.6%	94.7%	95.1%
Random Forest	98.2%	97.8%	97.6%	97.7%
Support Vector Machine	97.6%	97.1%	96.8%	96.9%
K-Nearest Neighbors	95.3%	94.5%	93.9%	94.1%
